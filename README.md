This repository contains a folder for the code used in a research article. The code replicates the figures and tables, and provides calibration code implemented in [CLIMADA Python](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python) using input data from [ISIMIP](https://www.isimip.org/) and [FAOSTAT](http://www.fao.org/faostat/).
